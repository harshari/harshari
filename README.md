## I'm an 4th year undergrad studying electronics. On the side I'm a developer, a maker and a musician. 👋
- 📊 I’ve previously worked on AR with Lenskart. Check them out [here](https://www.instagram.com/ar/2667111130205123/). Use your Instagram(mobile app) to try  
- 🔭 ~I’m currently working on developing a course for Physical Computing at TI-CEPD under [Prof. Dhananjay Gadre](http://www.dvgadre.com/)~ I tought the course to about 60 Physics Honors student on Scientific Computing (yaay) from Delhi University.
- 🌱 ~I'm learning to backflip and saving to skydive next Summer!~ I ended up Bungee Jumping with my friend [Devansh Jain Naval](https://in.linkedin.com/in/devansh-jain-nawal) in 2021 August. I'm too busy to skydive anytime soon. 
- 💻 During Covid I volunteered for Delhi Government as a React Developer at http://corona.delhi.gov.in/ and Maulaana Azad Medical College to help manage their Covid patient database. Read about it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itsharshari_doctors-coronapandemic-coronawarriors-activity-6686302231144271872-ON_m). 
- 💻 I didn't use GitHub previously to share my work and had things on my drive, in a couple of next weeks hope to get most of the things here in the open for collaborations and inspirations. 
- ~🏋️ As of Feb 2021, working on an iOS app to revolutionize the way people workout.~ I never was able to complete this project but can guide someone. 
- I have started my PhD in the US with great advisors Prof. Partha and Prof. Jana and feel grateful working with them. I'm blown by the amount of learning I get from these people and enjoying my time here in Washington. 
- I started [donateSmartphone.in](https://donatesmartphone.github.io/) before coming to the US and had a small impact I feel proud about.
