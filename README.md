### Hey there, I'm Harsh.
![Hey](https://github.com/harshari4299/harshari4299/blob/master/HARSH_readmeGIF.gif)

## As of September 2022,😃
## ~I'm an 4th year undergrad studying electronics~ Oh 1 year later I am doing PhD trying to make better ML accelerators. On the side I'm a developer, a maker and a musician. 👋
- Stoked to announce that out paper [SWAP: A Server-scale Communication-aware Chiplet-based Manycore PIM Accelerator]{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9852792} is a BEST PAPER CANDIDATE at ESWEEK 2022! All thanks to my collaborators Prof. [Partha]{https://eecs.wsu.edu/~pande/}, [Jana]{https://eecs.wsu.edu/~jana/}, [Sumit Mandal]{https://sumitkmandal.ece.wisc.edu/}, and [Umit Ogras]{https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Ogras_/} 😃. 

- 📊 I’ve previously worked on AR with Lenskart. Check them out [here](https://www.instagram.com/ar/2667111130205123/). Use your Instagram(mobile app) to try. 
- 🔭 ~I’m currently working on developing a course for Physical Computing at TI-CEPD under [Prof. Dhananjay Gadre](http://www.dvgadre.com/)~ I taught the course to about 60 Physics Honors student on Scientific Computing (yaay) from Delhi University.
- 🌱 ~I'm learning to backflip and saving to skydive next Summer!~ I ended up Bungee Jumping with my friend [Devansh Jain Naval](https://in.linkedin.com/in/devansh-jain-nawal) in 2021 August. I'm too busy to skydive anytime soon. I'm too unfit to learn backflip, I shall start with doing pushups first. 
- 💻 During Covid I volunteered for Delhi Government as a React Developer at http://corona.delhi.gov.in/ and Maulaana Azad Medical College to help manage their Covid patient database. Read about it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itsharshari_doctors-coronapandemic-coronawarriors-activity-6686302231144271872-ON_m). 
- 💻 ~I didn't use GitHub previously to share my work and had things on my drive, in a couple of next weeks hope to get most of the things here in the open for collaborations and inspirations.~ I realised too soon I suck at my documentation and should start by transferring skills I have which might be helpful to someone else. I hope to start publishing more of my work(Apr22).  
- ~🏋️ As of Feb 2021, working on an iOS app to revolutionize the way people workout.~ I never was able to complete this project but can guide someone. 
- Fall2021, I started my PhD in the US with great advisors [Prof. Partha](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~pande/) and [Prof. Jana](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~jana/) and feel grateful working with them. I'm blown by the amount of learning I get from these people and am enjoying my time here in Washington. 
- I have lost some friends, made new, first time living away from family and last year has been a roller coaster ride for me, changing me in multiple ways and I have started taking more responsibilities ending up doing everything myself as when my mom was always here to help me. I miss her a lot and I've never told but I love her(hoping she will never read this). 
- Throughout the summer 2021, I worked on [donateSmartphone.in](https://donatesmartphone.github.io/) before coming to the US and had a small impact I feel proud about. You can watch this video I made a while [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJSBfcc6PTk).
